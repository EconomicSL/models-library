# Models library
Collection of seminal agent-based models of economics systems replicated using ScalABM.  Primary purpose of this library is to demonstrate functionality of the underlying ScalABM libraries as well as to familiarize potential users with our tools.  Added bonus is that replication studies act as an additional set of [functional tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) for ScalABM!

The easiest way to interact with the models in the library is to click on the "Launch Binder" button above.  Clicking this button will launch the entire models library as a collection of interactive [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks running inside a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/) on top of [Kupernetes](http://kubernetes.io/). Hat tip to the folks at the [Binder Project](https://github.com/binder-project) for making this possible.
