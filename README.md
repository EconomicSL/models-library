# Models library
Collection of seminal agent-based models of economics systems replicated using ScalABM.  Primary purpose of this library is to demonstrate functionality of the underlying ScalABM libraries as well as to familiarize potential users with our tools.  Added bonus is that replication studies act as an additional set of [functional tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) for ScalABM!
